# TrickyAuth Challenge

The `TrickyAuth` contract deployed on Sepolia at address [0x1febc0f6e655196173c32ca4bf8ec27c75f5de2b](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1febc0f6e655196173c32ca4bf8ec27c75f5de2b#code) presents a challenge of getting authorized and stealing a little Sepolia ETH from the contract balance. This is a mid-level task that requires basic knowledge of Solidity assembly and EVM storage principles.
